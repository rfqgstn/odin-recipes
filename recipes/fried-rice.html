	<h1>Fried Rice</h1>

	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>The literal translation of Nasi Goreng is “fried rice” in Indonesian and Malaysian – and that’s exactly what it is! It’s mainly rice with just a little bit of meat and just onion for the vegetables. The thing that distinguishes it from other Fried Rice dishes is the sauce which is made with kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce that stains the rice dark brown and caramelises the rice when it cooks.</p>
	<p>Typically it’s served with a sunny side up egg (love how the yolk runs into the rice!) and a side of fresh cucumber and tomato (no dressing) to make a meal of it.</p>

	<h3>Ingredient</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Cabai merah - 5 buah</li>
		<li>Bawang merah - 5 butir</li>
		<li>Bawang putih - 3 siung</li>
		<li>Kemiri - 2 butir</li>
		<li>Kunyit - 1 ruas jari</li>
	</ul>



	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Sauté flavour base – Start by sautéing onion, garlic and bacon</li>
		<li>Add diced vegetables – I’ve used frozen corn, carrots and peas for convenience here, but any diced vegetables will be great</li>
		<li>Add cooked cold rice and sauce and give it a toss.</li>
		<li>Move everything to the side and scramble egg in the wok or pan. It sounds cheeky, but actually, this is a technique common in Thai Stir Fries, like in the ever popular Pad See Ew. It works great!</li>
		<li>Add green onion and toss it all together, then serve immediately!</li>
	</ol>
